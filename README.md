The TD Xml Plugin was specifically created for use by Janus Research Training Developers to assist in the creation of Xml based simulation modules.

Features:
- Renumbering tool which quickly renumbers an Xml module, completely removing the need for someone to complete this tedious task by hand.
- Step Count tool which tallies the steps entered by a developer in an Xml module
- Audio Document Script Generator which processes one or more Xml modules and creates word documents with the necessary information.
- Custom Xml Console for reporting changes, issues, etc to the user.
- Custom inspections with warnings/fixes for various items related to the Xml layout, formatting, and component relations.
